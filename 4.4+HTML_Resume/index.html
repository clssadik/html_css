    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I have been passionate about technology since I was a child, always curious about how things work and eager to learn more. This passion led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, where I am currently expanding my knowledge in programming, algorithms, and software development. Throughout my studies, I have enjoyed working on practical projects that challenge me to solve real problems and improve my skills. I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological advancements and continuously grow as a developer. I am excited to apply what I’ve learned in both academic and real-world environments to make a positive impact.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chemical Equilibrium Calculator (chem.py)</strong></li> <br>
            A web application developed to compute chemical equilibrium concentrations for user-defined reactions using numerical methods. Implemented multiple root-finding algorithms (Bisection, Brentq, Secant, Newton-Raphson) and multivariate Newton’s method with direct solver and LU decomposition to solve nonlinear systems. Integrated a dynamic Flask-based interface with real-time plotting using Matplotlib, enabling users to input reaction parameters and visualize equilibrium functions. Optimized for accuracy and user experience with responsive design using CSS and JavaScript.

            <br> <br>
            
            <li><strong>Population Growth Analysis Tool (population_growth.py)</strong></li> <br>
            A desktop application built with Tkinter to analyze and predict global population trends using real-world data. Employed SciPy for numerical integration (Trapezoid, Simpson, quad) and interpolation (linear, cubic, spline) to model population dynamics. Developed a logistic growth model with curve fitting and visualized predictions through Matplotlib. Included derivative analysis and floating-point error comparison, presented via an interactive GUI with a modern, card-based layout for enhanced usability.
